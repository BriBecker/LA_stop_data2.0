# Analyzing LA Open Data
## Testing the Veil of Darkness Hypothesis

Los Angeles police stop data was originally downloaded from [data.lacity.org](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Stop-Data-Open-Data-2015) in early 2016 summer (although privileges seemed to have changed recently)

Los Angeles sunset/sunrise times have been acquired from http://sunrise.maplogs.com/los_angeles_county_ca_usa.926.html (most recently as of 2016-12-14).

For convenience, LA Police Stop data (zipped) and sunset data is contained in *raw_data* directory.
