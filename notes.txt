The basic idea is
to use changes in natural lighting to establish a benchmark, on the assumption that
after dark, police officers suffer a degraded ability to detect motorists’ race; the pattern
of stops during darkness represents the presumptively more race-neutral benchmark,
against which the pattern of stops during daytime can be compared


. The comparison is
limited to stops that occur “near the boundary of daylight and darkness,” in what has
been called the “intertwilight” period, lest the analysis confound differences in officers’
decisions to stop with changes in the composition of the driving (and violator)
population across the hours of the day

 If a higher percentage of blacks are stopped during the day than at night, it is reasoned, then bias exists.

STREETLIGHT INFO
He and Rohlin used geographic information system software and, using data from 512 Syracuse police officers’ 
records from 2006 to 2009, they correlated traffic stops with the location of city streetlights. When they
 contrasted well-lit night-time locations with those having little or no ambient lighting, they again found
 significant patterns suggesting that, when the race of vehicle occupants is known, bias exists. 
The odds of a black driver being stopped, relative to nonblack drivers, increases 15 percent in lighted situations.

TRAINING/EXP FIXES BIAS
One preliminary finding is that rookie officers (those with five years’ experience or less), 
when unaccompanied by an experienced officer, stop and search innocent black citizens at a 
disproportionately high rate. Further analysis suggests racial bias fades with experience. 

Their methodology "differences out" the at-risk population of drivers by assuming that
the racial mix of the at-risk population does not change between daylight and darkness. Of course this
assumption will not hold in general (Hammermesh, 1996). To ensure that it does, they focus their analysis
on stops made during the intertwilight period (approximately 5:00pm to 9:30pm), during which it may be
either dark or light depending on the time of year due to the daylight savings time change.

 However, this
may not be enough of a refinement to ensure that the racial mix of the at-risk population does not change
between daylight and darkness. They, therefore, treat time as continuous and embed the profiling test into
a logistical regression, allowing for a test that conditions on the time of day, and consequently refines the
precision of the equality of at-risk populations between day and night.
